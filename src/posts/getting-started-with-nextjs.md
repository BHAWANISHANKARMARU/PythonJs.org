# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated (SSG) web applications with ease. It comes with a lot of features out-of-the-box, making development faster and more efficient.

## Why Next.js?

1.  **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG):** Improves performance and SEO.
2.  **File-system Routing:** Simple and intuitive routing based on your file structure.
3.  **API Routes:** Easily build backend API endpoints within your Next.js project.
4.  **Optimized for Production:** Automatic code splitting, image optimization, and more.

## Installation

To create a new Next.js project, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

This will set up a new Next.js project and start the development server. You can then open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see your new application.

Next.js simplifies many aspects of web development, allowing you to focus on building great user experiences.
