Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

## Why Django?

1.  **Batteries-included:** Comes with many features out of the box, like an ORM, admin panel, and authentication system.
2.  **Scalability:** Designed to handle high traffic and complex applications.
3.  **Security:** Provides built-in protections against many common web vulnerabilities.
4.  **Community:** Large and active community, offering extensive documentation and support.

## Key Features

-   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** Interact with your database using Python objects.
-   **Admin Interface:** Automatically generated administrative interface for managing data.
-   **URL Routing:** Clean and powerful URL dispatcher.
-   **Template Engine:** Flexible and secure templating system.

Django is an excellent choice for building robust, scalable, and secure web applications, from simple websites to complex platforms.
