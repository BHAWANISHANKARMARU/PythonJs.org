# Understanding CSS Modules

![CSS Modules](/file.svg)

CSS Modules are a popular solution for encapsulating styles in web development, particularly within component-based architectures like React and Next.js. They solve common CSS problems such as global scope, naming collisions, and maintainability.

## What are CSS Modules?

At its core, a CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. This means that when you write CSS in a `.module.css` file, those styles are unique to the component that imports them, preventing unintended side effects across your application.

## Benefits

1.  **Local Scope:** No more global CSS conflicts. Each component's styles are isolated.
2.  **No Naming Collisions:** You can use simple, readable class names without worrying about them clashing with other styles.
3.  **Maintainability:** Easier to refactor and delete CSS without affecting other parts of your application.
4.  **Composition:** You can still compose styles from different modules.

## How to Use

In a Next.js project, you can create a file like `MyComponent.module.css`:

```css
.container {
  background-color: blue;
  padding: 20px;
}

.title {
  color: white;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

Then, import and use it in your React component:

```jsx
import styles from './MyComponent.module.css';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1 className={styles.title}>Hello, CSS Modules!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

CSS Modules provide a robust way to manage styles in large applications, leading to more organized and scalable codebases.
